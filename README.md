# WhatToWatch
This is a quick react project created with TMDb.

I also used some anothe tools and libraris like Sass and react-spring and YouTube API. This project show current popular movies and seach for any movie you like based on gener or text input to see details about them. I also includet trailers from YouTube for each movie.

This Project took me around 2 week and i learn a lot about fatching data from api and Asynchronous JavaScript. This was also one of my fist bigger projcet i've ever done. Also gain some expiriences about Git and GitHub.
